"""Regression tests that drive the API through the official ``openai`` SDK.

The `/v1/responses` endpoint (C1) was verified by hand against openai 3.37.0;
these tests lock that in so a future change cannot silently break SDK
compatibility. Requires the ``openai`` package (declared in the ``dev`` extra).
